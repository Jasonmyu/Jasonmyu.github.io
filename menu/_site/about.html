<p>Hello! My name is Jason Yu, and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of
California, Irvine. I am also an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, part of a
fellowship program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (More info can
be found here: https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My research interests involve the
development and application of quantum chemistry methods, particularly those which involve
Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Coupled Cluster (CC). 
To learn more about my research, including ongoing work, you can visit the “Research” section in the sidebar above.</p>

<p>I have a Masters degree from the California Institute of Technology in Quantum Chemistry. There, I worked on developing excited-state methods for periodic systems. I also expanded my skill-set through taking classes in machine learning and data science. I take special interest in how these quantitative methods can be used to solve scientific problems.</p>

<p>I also hold a Bachelors Degree in Chemistry from UCI, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude. During my undergraduate study, I was recognized for a number of academic achievements. A list of some accolades can be found in the “Media” section.</p>

<p>Aside from scientific research, I also aspire to become a worthy mentor and educator to help improve scientific literacy in America. I hope to be of service not just to college-age students in the lecture hall, but also to younger students with interest in STEM fields.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I like to sing and play the piano. My musical influences come from many genres, but I am especially fond of artists like Bill Evans and Chet Baker.</p>

<p>When I can, I also enjoy traveling. You can catch a glipse of my adventures in the “Photos” section.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest, and please do not hesitate to contact me through any means listed on the “Contact” page.</p>
