<p>Hello! My name is Jason Yu, and I am a Ph.D. student at the California Institute of Technology. I am also an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, part of a fellowship program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (More info can be found here: https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My research interests involve the development of ab-initio quantum chemistry methods, particularly those which involve Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs) to study Condensed Phase Systems. To learn more about my research, including ongoing work, you can visit the “Research” section above.</p>

<p>For my undergraduate education, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of California, Irvine in 2017 with a Bachelors Degree in Chemistry. There, I also received Campuswide Honors and Honors in Chemistry for my academic achievements. A list of additional accolades from my undergraduate career can be found in the “Media” section.</p>

<p>Aside from scientific research, I also aspire to become a worthy mentor and educator to help facilitate progress towards improving scientific literacy in America. I hope to be of service not just to college-age students in the lecture hall, but also to younger students with interest in STEM fields. You can view the rest of my teaching statement here.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy piano and vocal performance. My musical influences come from many genres, but I am especially fond of artists like Bill Evans and Chet Baker.</p>

<p>When I can, I also enjoy traveling. Most recently, I was able to visit China and Japan in the Summer of 2017. You can catch a glipse of my adventures in the “Photos” section.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest, and please do not hesitate to contact me!</p>
