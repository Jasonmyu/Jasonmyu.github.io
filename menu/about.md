Hello! My name is Jason Yu, and I am a current Ph.D. student studying
computational chemistry at the University of
California, Irvine and a former Co-op of the Medicinal Chemistry group at
Biogen. I am also an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, part of a
fellowship program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (More info can
be found here: https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My research interests involve the
development and application of computational chemistry methods, particularly those which involve
Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), to
study the properties of small-molecules and chemical systems. The
results of my research projects have found application in the fields
of quantum computing and drug discovery. 
To learn more about my research, including ongoing work, 
you can visit the "Research" section in the sidebar above. 

I obtained my M.S. degree in computational chemistry from the California Institute of Technology. 
There, I worked on developing excited-state methods for periodic systems. 
I also expanded my skill-set through taking classes in machine learning and data science. 
I take special interest in how these quantitative methods can be used to solve scientific problems.

I hold my B.S. in Chemistry from UCI, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude.
During my undergraduate study, I was recognized for a number of academic
achievements, such as the Chancellor's Award for Excellence in
Undergraduate Research.  A list of some accolades can be found in the "Media" section.

Aside from scientific research, I also aspire to become a worthy mentor
and educator to help improve scientific education in the United States. 
I hope to be of service not just to college-age students in the lecture hall, 
but also to younger students with interest in STEM fields. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I like to sing and play the piano. My musical influences come from many genres, 
but I am especially fond of artists like Bill Evans and Chet Baker. 

When I can, I also enjoy traveling. You can catch a glipse of my adventures in the "Photos" section.

Thank you for your interest, and please do not hesitate to contact me through any means listed on the "Contact" page.
